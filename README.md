# Neovim configuration

This is my personal neovim configuration. It is a work in progress and I am constantly tweaking it.
It was originally based on [Astronvim](https://astronvim.com/), but I switched to [Lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
to restart from a more minimal configuration and progressively customize it to my needs.
